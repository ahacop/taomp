The problem states that Bob can't see Alice's can, but it doesn't say anything about whether Alice can see Bob's can, so we assume that she can.

Bob has two cans on his windowsill with strings attached that Alice can pull.

In the fable, the text describes Bob placing the can standing up on Alice's windowsill, thus setting the initial state. We can do the same here, and say that Bob initially places both cans down on his windowsill.

When Alice wants to release the pets, she does the following:

1. She waits until Bob's cans are up
2. She releases the pets and pulls down Bob's first can.
3. When the pets return, Alice checks whether they finished the food. If so, she pulls down Bob's second can.

Bob does the following:

1. He waits until both his cans are down.
2. He puts food in the yard.
3. He resets his cans.
